The AI engineer successfully migrated and enhanced a humor-diario mental health application from a GitHub repository to an Expo React Native frontend with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The initial task involved building the existing app for the Emergent preview, which then evolved into several feature enhancements and bug fixes based on user feedback.

Key steps included: setting up the environment; integrating the Emergent LLM Key for the Dr. Ana chat; removing subscription blocks to enable all features; implementing a named level system (Jornada de Crescimento Emocional) and changing XP to Estrelas; fixing mission icon and star display issues; adding a proactive Dr. Ana chat prompt for low moods; clarifying and renaming the mood history screen; and implementing four high-priority features: Gratitude Journal, Breathing Exercises, SOS button, and Custom Reminders, which included extensive backend debugging for API registration and MongoDB  serialization. The work concluded with integrating local notifications for reminders, addressing various UI/UX refinements throughout.

The user's explicit request was to build the humor-diario project from a given GitHub repository (https://github.com/adriano7monteiro/humor-diario) in React Native for Expo preview. This daily mood tracker app was to be made fully functional, including:
1.  **AI Chat Integration**: Utilize the Emergent LLM Key for the Dr. Ana therapeutic chat functionality.
2.  **Full Feature Access**: Remove any subscription blockages, making all app resources available.
3.  **Comprehensive Implementation**: Implement all functionalities, adhering to the correct user flow.

Beyond the initial build, subsequent user requests led to enhancements and fixes:
4.  **Gamification Naming**: Implement a themed naming system for user levels (Jornada de Crescimento Emocional) instead of numerical levels.
5.  **Terminology Change**: Replace XP with Estrelas (Stars) for gamification points.
6.  **Proactive Mood Support**: Trigger a prompt to chat with Dr. Ana when a user registers Muito Triste or Triste moods, passing the mood context to the chat.
7.  **Mood History Display**: Ensure a clear display of the last 7 days of mood history.
8.  **Rename Progresso Emocional**: Change the name of the emotional progress screen to Progresso de Humor.
9.  **High-Priority Feature Development**: Implement four new high-priority features:
    *   **Diário de Gratidão**: A daily gratitude journal.
    *   **Exercícios de Respiração Guiados**: Guided breathing exercises.
    *   **Botão SOS**: A quick access crisis support button.
    *   **Lembretes e Hábitos Personalizados**: Custom daily reminders.
10. **UI/UX Refinements**: Remove specific introductory cards from the Home screen, ensure proper card spacing, and fix UI issues like non-appearing modals and unclickable buttons.
11. **Background Notifications**: Enable local background notifications for reminders, including scheduling, cancellation, and permission handling.

<pending_tasks>
-   The Jornada de Crescimento Emocional level names are displayed, but visual badge/emblem integration for each level was suggested but not yet implemented.
-   The SOS / Botão de Crise screen was created, but specific content like grounding techniques, emergency contacts, or playlists might need further population.
-   Advanced features suggested by the AI engineer (e.g., Sleep Tracker, Guided Meditations, Triggers and Patterns, Anonymous Community) remain to be implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the complete local notification functionality for the Lembretes e Hábitos Personalizados feature. This involved:
1.  **Rewriting **: To include functions for requesting notification permissions, scheduling recurring notifications (based on reminder time and days), and canceling/re-scheduling notifications.
2.  **Integrating with **: Modifying the , , and  functions within  to utilize the  functions. This ensures that when a user creates, enables/disables, or deletes a reminder, the corresponding local notification is scheduled or canceled.

The AI engineer completed the necessary edits to  and the , , and  functions in . The last action was to restart Expo to apply these changes. The objective is to enable the app to send background notifications for user-set reminders when the app is running in Expo Go or as a compiled native app.

<optional_next_step>
Restart Expo and confirm that the local notification functionality is correctly integrated and working within the  screen.
