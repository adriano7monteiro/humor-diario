The previous AI engineer successfully expanded a mental health application, humor-diario. Initially, the focus was on migrating the app to Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB, integrating an Emergent LLM for Dr. Ana chat, and implementing core features like gamification, gratitude journal, breathing exercises, SOS, and reminders with local notifications. The work then pivoted to significant UI/UX improvements on the home screen, reordering cards for better visibility. Subsequently, a comprehensive in-app ebook store with real Stripe payment integration (card and PIX) was developed. More recently, the scope broadened significantly to external web projects: a standalone B2B corporate licensing website with Stripe payments, and a separate marketing landing page for the app. The current task involves completing support and legal pages for this landing page and linking them correctly, demonstrating the engineer's ability to manage diverse frontend and backend development across multiple project types.
